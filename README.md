# LoginGui Java Program

LoginGui is a Java program that creates a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for a login page. It prompts the user for a username and password, and upon clicking the login button, checks if the input matches a pre-defined username and password ("login" and "password" respectively). If the input matches, it displays a "Welcome" message in a pop-up dialog box. Otherwise, it displays an "Invalid username or password" message.
